DuplExpellio 1.0.0
------------------

This is a simple plugin for Sublime Text that adds the ability to quickly select (by default) 
or remove (optional) all redundant entries in a document, or in the user's selected text.

It will attempt to differentiate entries if there are delimiters in place, otherwise it will
use the selections of each individual word (delimited by spaces).

This is my second plugin for Sublime Text. My first plugin 'Lensort' sorts lines by their length
and is purely for aesthetics, whereas this plugin has more of a practical application.

Lensort can be searched for in Sublime Text's command palette via `Package Control: Install Package`
