DuplExpellio
------------

This Sublime Text plugin allows you to select or remove duplicate entries like magic.

Usage Options
-------------

  - Right click, or select from the 'Edit' menu, "Select or Remove Duplicates" by 
    default the plugin will "Select" all duplicate entries in the file, or in the 
    selected text.

    Alternatively, if you choose to implement the suggested key bindings...
    (which can be viewed/enabled in the `Default (<your OS>).sublime-keymap` file)
    ...then simply press the defined keybinding, suggested: "Ctrl+Shift+U"

  - In the plugin settings, there are the following options:

      * delimiters: this is a list of delimiters the plugin will attempt, in the order 
        they appear, as a qualifying delimiter is determined.
        
        Note: the last delimiter is a space, this is a catch all, should the other 
        potential delimiters not qualify, this one will almost always qualify and 
        compares each individual word within the file.

      * threshold: this is the minimum number of occurrances required to qualify as a 
        delimiter. This is used to ensure the appropriate delimiter is used for the 
        targeted text.

      * do_with_duplicates_found: there are two options for this variable, 'select' or
        'expell', 'select' highlights the duplicate entries found, whereas 'expell' 
        removes the duplicate entries found, skipping the verification afforded by the 
        'select' option.

I hope this plugin serves you well, if you have any issues using it, or discover a bug, 
please reach out and let me know.
